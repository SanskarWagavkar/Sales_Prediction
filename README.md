# Sales_Prediction
In this project we have a dataset of Big Mart sales, from kaggle.  ·     Data cleaning and visualization was performed on the dataset.  ·     Machine Learning’s Decision tree regression algorithm was implemented on dataset to predict the sales of each item and  ·     To know whether customers prefer fatty or non-fatty products to consume.  ·     Also we found what type of store customers prefer most.
